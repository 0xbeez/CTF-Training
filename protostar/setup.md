### An introductory-level set up tutorial of protostar  
  


## Introduction to Exploit exercises:  
At the Homepage of [Exploit Exercises](https://exploit-exercises.lains.space/), you can read *exploit-exercises.com provides a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues.*  
We will be interested in the tasks of exploit development in the context of pwn (Binary Exploitation). Although it is one of the most complex categories of Cyber Security, Protostar can be a good starting point as it offers tasks in memory corruption issues(buffer overflow, heap exploitation ...) in a friendly env. (absence of security mitigations)
