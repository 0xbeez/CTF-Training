# Introduction to scripting with python:  
A guide to help you get up and running with scripting. Python will be used here as it is broadly adapted among the InfoSec community all over the world.  
## Versioning:  
There exist two flavors of Python, 2.X and 3.X. And since [2.X is nearly retired](https://pythonclock.org/), we will only cover Python3. Don't worry, there are no huge gaps in the syntax and you can go on from here and read some of the existent code in py2. This diff in versions is only necessary to understand why sometimes code may seem right, but not working.  
  
## PEPs and The Zen of Python:  
Index of Python Enhancement Proposals, also known as PEPs is a reference to all python officially related topics such as deprecation of Standard Modules, Guidelines for Language Evolution and bug fixes ... all described in the 0'th PEP [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).  
**The Zen of Python** : Python is more than a programming/scripting language. It has its own set of rules and philosophy. That can be found in [the 20'th pep](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) or by importing this in the REPL.  
```python
import this
```
